## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi! I'm **Khushi**, a developer, designer, and aspiring **Product Manager**.

I believe products should not only work — they should *feel* intuitive, thoughtful, and human. I enjoy building small tools like this one that solve real problems with simplicity. This project reflects my belief that even the smallest interactions — like counting words — deserve polish, empathy, and user-centered thinking.

My journey into **Product Management** is driven by curiosity:  
- Why do users behave a certain way?
- What makes a tool truly delightful?
- How can we bridge design, tech, and business for impact?

This project — though simple — represents how I approach both code and product: with clarity, care, and purpose.
